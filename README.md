# Correlating Gross Earnings of Hollywood Movies with Other Variables using Jupyter Notebook

This project explores the relationship between the gross earnings of Hollywood movies and other variables such as production budget, genre, release date, and runtime. The goal is to derive correlations and provide insights into the factors that influence a movie's commercial success.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is obtained from Box Office Mojo, a website that provides box office revenue data for movies. The dataset contains information about Hollywood movies released between 2010 and 2019, including their budget, gross earnings, genre, release date, and runtime.

## Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

## Files

movies.csv: contains the raw data used in the analysis

Movie Correlation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code used to explore the data and derive correlations

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the factors that influence the commercial success of Hollywood movies. By exploring the correlations between the gross earnings of movies and other variables such as production budget, genre, release date, and runtime, we can gain insights into the movie industry's dynamics and identify potential strategies for success. The project demonstrates the use of Jupyter Notebook, Python, and data visualization tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and explore large datasets.
